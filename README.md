# Elevator-system

The elevator system is meticulously designed with a user-centric approach. Within this system, there are elevator units akin to buildings, each housing a number of elevators. When a user initiates a request, the elevator system autonomously responds by moving either upwards or downwards based on the user's input. The algorithm governing the elevator's response to requests can undergo further optimization for enhanced efficiency. Additionally, the operational status of an elevator, whether it is currently in service or not, can be seamlessly updated through API calls. For detailed information, please refer to the documentation provided in the DOCS.md file.
